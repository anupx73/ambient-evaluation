\section{Abstract}
Service oriented architecture is at the bleeding edge today and the technologies around it keeps evolving including the service mesh in Kubernetes environment. There are number of successful service mesh products used in current technology space and one of the pioneer is Istio, a Cloud Native Foundation project initially developed by Google and IBM in association with Lyft, the Envoy proxy development team. The use of Envoy proxy in Istio has already made its mark few years back and the sidecar injection implementation is battle tested. The standard of sidecar injection is solid and well tested but practitioners always wanted to improve the resource utilization side of it, hence a new architecture pattern of Istio is born as Ambient mesh. This architecture provides the service mesh capabilities without the sidecar injection to service pods in Kubernetes cluster and claims to provide better performance without any security compromises. This paper aims at evaluating this state-of-the-art technology from performance and operational complexity perspective over Istio's sidecar mode. With the release of ambient mesh alpha version, the potential of this technology is explored in grey literature but there is no formal literature written till date and this paper is going to establish several facts based on testing performed on Google Cloud infrastructure.
